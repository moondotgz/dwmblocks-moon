# dwmblocks-zowws
Dwm's status bar is painful, just like dwmblocks. This is my configuration of dwmblocks.
# Patches
* [statuscmd (this is literally the only patch in existence](https://gist.github.com/IGeraGera/e4a5583b91b3eec2e81fdceb44dea717)
# Requirements
* make (to build dwmblocks)
* git (to clone the repo)
* GNU CoreUtils (for commands like date)
* awk (for cutting out useless pieces of the command)
# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/zowws/dwmblocks-zowws.git
cd dwmblocks-zowws/dwmblocks
sudo make install
```
